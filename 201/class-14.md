# CSS Transforms, Transitions, and Animations/What Google Learned About Teams

- [201 Home](https://fadnesscharlie.github.io/reading-notes/201/)

## CSS3

With CSS we can create animations. From transformations, to transitions, and to animation. Understanding how to do all of this is its own class. But understanding what can be done, and how to do it will help in the future by first, showing your employer that you are bad ass in CSS, but also being able to wow your clients in making them just that more interested in what else you can do. And just think if you added JS to it, the possibilities are endless on what you can do.

Watching these animations, having each change, each bounce, each interval, all of these aspects combine to create the object to move, change, and make other things happen. When you are breaking it down, its not to difficult when you understand what is going on, how to code it all out, and how to modify it to do exactly what else you want it do to.

## What Google Learned About Teams

To summerize this, it would be that, even though you want to optimize something. Knowing that not everything can be optimized, but if it can grow together and build a bond, thats a better option in the long run the doing test and running it by numbers instead of experience.

Everyone has thier own way of learning, leading, and following. Understanding each person and how they effectively work on a small scale, means a lot more then trying to put everyone in one giant pool and seperate them. Instead, let them choose their own small pool, and build their own friendship and group.
