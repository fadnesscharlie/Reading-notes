## How computer works

## What makes a computer a computer

A computer is made of 4 basic tasks. Input, Store, Process, and Output. Every computer uses these four simple steps to activate, run commands, and does what we want the computer to do for us.

### Take input

What the world does, what we tell it to do. The input is information that we decide we want to do. We can either have a program running, tell it to run another program, or stop a program. Without us telling the computer what to do, the computer is just wires and code sitting there.

### Store input

The information that we input needs to be stored, think of it like our brain, it needs a place to store that information, let us think about, choose what we want or not want to happen. Then when we want the same action to happen again, when it is stored, the computer can easily access and output for us since it is stored in memory.

### Process

The process of a computer is all those binary code lines running, printing out those 0's and 1's that create the code, process, action, that we want, then sends it output that stored information.

### Output

The output is what we see when we click, open, use, or command something. From typing on the key, to displaying the text that we see on the screen now. It took in the input of the command we wanted, stored it, processed it, and now output that task for us to use.

## How computers are made from Binary Code

Wires are ususally On or off, 0 or 1, True or False. With more wires, you get more circuts, which then creates what we want

Number's in Binary 1, 0, 0, 1. This actually represents the number 9. From the right, the first number represents 1, then 2, then 4, then 8.

or:
`1 0 0 1`  
`8 4 2 1`

We then take the top row of Binary numbers. And we multiply. 

`1 * 8 = 8`
`0 * 4 = 0`
`0 * 2 = 0`
`1 * 1 = 1`

And now we add. `8 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 9`

When we store letters to numbers. And even the sound waves have their own represented number, and as we add store those numbers, we can recreate those numbers

When we take this to a larger scale. With 32 wires or 0's and 1's. We can create/store numbers to over 4 BILLION!

Adding circuits is how you create bigger and more numbers. On a circuit board, there is just a bunch of smaller curcuits that all create a mass amount of output that creates a computer.

## How software controls hardware

Software controls the hardware by telling the CPU what it wants to do. The CPU then activates the program you want, taking input and putting output to use or use as input for something else. The hardware is simular to the high way, the high way controls where cars can go, how fast, and when to enter and leave. But the software is us, the cars the enter the highway, choose how fast to go, or when to leave.
