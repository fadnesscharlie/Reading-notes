## Variables

When making a variable, they all start with a "`var`", this is a **variable keyword**. Comes after it is your **variable name**. Example would be `var quantity;`.

Assigning a variable uses an assignment operator `=`. Example of this would be `quantity = 3;`. The `3` would be **variable value**.

Storing a variable is different between numbers and strings. String being one or more letters or words. Numbers `5` are just by themselves, while strings `'words in my string'` use quotes, either single or double. Just make sure that both quotes are the same, wether single or double. If your using quotes inside a string like **let's**, make sure to change your outer quotes to oposite of what your using inside.

## Linking JS

When adding JavaScript to your program, you want to make sure to be able to link your page to your HTML page. As HTML reads from top to bottom, you want to place this near your CSS link for JS to run everything as the page is being rendered.

When linking, you want to make sure, in your JS to mention and write out where you want your JS actions to take place. Wether that be in the beginning, or in certain tags throughout the whole page. Example of this would be, if you wanted JS to make sure they displayed the person's Birthday in the correct spot, you want to make sure the tag is correct or else the Birthday could be displayed in a random place, or no where if HTML does not know where you want this specific action to take place at.

## Comments

Comments are very useful to descibe what is happening in the program. Sometimes it can be difficult to see what it happening at a glace, but making a small comment on what is going on makes understanding your code, and makes other people reading your code very easy as well.

One other thing that commenting is very good for is how when making a function or script. Commenting on what is going on, as in writing everything out on a whtie board before tackling the problem can make things very easy, as everything is on paper for you to outline and follow through with.

## Boolean

Booleans are very simple. They are either **True or False**, **0,1**, or simple as a **yes** or **no**. Boolean's are very nice to use if their is only one outcome.
