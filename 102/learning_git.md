Here a small list of things that I have learned from Git

## Repository

Repositories are very useful because it like adding all of your information or code into a small book and storing into a very large virtual library. And to check out these books you can use Git to clone them to your local machine, write, read, or even study the information and even send it back.

## Commits

A way to track what you have done. It makes a long list of every commit you have done. You can even make a comment 'git commit -m "what you did/changed' on the commits as well which helps others with understanding what you have done.

## ACP

Three simple concepts to make sure everything runs smooth while using Git.

- `git add "your file/repo`
  - This allows you add something to your workspace
- `git commit -m "changes made"`
  - Commit those changes
- `git push origin master`
  - Push it back to the origial repo

With all of this combined and a lot more. Is the basics of Git.
