# Charlie Fadness's First Github Pages

> Hello! Thank you for coming and learning along side my journey into Software Development! In these reading notes, I will be adding information about topics that I have learned and went over. They will be explained in a way that even a person who has never wrote code will understand. I hope you learn a lot by reading, and I hope it guides you with more information about Software Development and what it does, and what you can do with it all. In my Reading Notes 102, I will be explaining just the basics. This will cover a little bit of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to give you a small understanding of everything and how it works together to build a website. Later in the following 201, 301, and 401, we will go deeper into the Development side into creating apps, responsive websites, and more! Look forward everything!
