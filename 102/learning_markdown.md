## Learning JavaScript Programming

Through all the things I have learned through this course so far are a lot of useful features that you may run into and never bothering to open, or even look it.
Today I'll explain a few of those features to you!

- Github
- Mindset
- Growth
- Markdown
- Professionalism  

I'll explain our topics in some short summaries of each.

## Github

Github is a place where you can store information. It's very much like a digital library. You can visit it, take some code(with authorization of course), store your own code,
make your own library section as well!

## Mindset

Mindset is how you think, act, and do something. Having a solid mindset of doing something can promote a healthly work environment, prioritization, and goal accomplishments.
Acting upon doing something vs doing something to act upon it two different thing. It is how you tackle that situation. Do you solve this problem with a set goal and steps in mind? O
Or do you decide how your going to do it as you come accross it? In the end your finsihing your task, but with what effort and time is the real key to mindset.

## Growth

Always growing is a fantastic thing. Being able to see a tree that was planted on your 10th birthday, watching it grow fruit in a matter years, and forming a strong foundation in
its roots to hold everything it has accomplished since its birth. But dont forget where you started, and where you are. Never stop growing, because there is so many trees out there,
so many different environments for each of those trees.

## Markdown

Markdown is a language that in my opinion is like a simple HTLM/CSS for dummies. It takes just small key strokes to do what a whole line can accomplish. Fitting everything
into one page, making it look nice, all without being confused or wondering if you forgot a bracket or parentheses somewhere. It makes things things much easier for the average
person to do.

## Professionalism

Being professional is very important. From how you present yourself, or even an image of yourself or even how you write someone an email an say a lot about someone. It shows
maturity, discipline, and confidence. From beginning to end you want to show professionalism, it provides people with knowledge that you know how to act, most importantly, it
is very good to practice, even to train your subconscious to be able to perform whenever need be, to erase bad habits that might have formed.

Here are things that I learned from class so far. I hope this has helped you in any way or form, whether knowledge or ideas. Thank you very much for reading and I look forward
to showing you so much more information in the future!
