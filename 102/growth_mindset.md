Hello! My name is Charlie, things about me would be I love anime, playing POE, baking, helping people, and outdoors. I am looking forward to coding as a new career pathway and seeing where coding/programming can take me. The joruney ahead is going to a tough climb, but with perseverance I will move forward, carve a path and layout a trail of my own so that no matter where I stand on this mountain. I can always look back and see how far I have progressed and obstacles that I have overcome! My perfered pronouns are he, him, and his. Thank you for visiting my webiste! I hope it can help you move forward in any obstacles that come along your journey.

## Growth Mindset

**Explaining Growth Mindset in my own words would be:**

- [x] Understanding how your subconcious works
- [x] Retraining your brain and subconcious
- [x] Keep training and continue to train your growth

Growth mindset is all about how we push ourselfs and move forward. Understanding our faults first will be the first task to growth. If you understand where your growth has stopped and what is stopping it, you can grow that part of you to overcome your struggles and move forward.

## To keep myself in a growth mindset

1. Thinking about the future
2. Learning is growing and growing is learning
3. Self improvement/development

Thank you for reading this webpage! I look forward to working with you in the future!
