## HTML Structure

The structure of a HTML file is the basics to all pages. It gives it sections for you to create your content. In those sections, we can add many different things, `lines of code`,
HTML tags, and in those tags we can place many things, including images, links, paragraphs, navigation, and many more things. Below we will look more in depth on what goes into an HTML page.  
We start off our structure using a wireframe. Think of taking a piece of paper and pen, and stetching out the layout of how our website wanted to look. Where do we want to place our navigation bar, maybe an image that captures the concept of our site, our articles of writing, or how about a help bar on the bottom of the screen with easy links that helps the user find information if they are stuck. In the beginning, there would be much writing, mainly lots of squares and rectangles outlining everything for us.

## HTML Tags

Tags always start with  `<` and end with `>`. There are two main differences between tags, those are opening `<h1>` and closing tags `</h1>`, and self closing tags `<img>`. Most times when they have an opening and closing tag. You can place type what you want in between the two tags `<h1>`Opening`</h1>`, and in the self closing `<img="Link-to-your-image">`. There can be mutliple of the same tags, but becareful to not get to confused, and later when we add CSS, you want to make sure that some very unique and specific to itself so that you can change the look, style, or shape of that "block" of tag.

## White Space

White space does not matter much when it comes down to HTML. HTML does not read white space as anything specific, which makes it quite nice, as we can seperate things which makes it easier to read for our eyes. If we coding in a way that HTML reads it. Well lets just say it would literally look like a giant paragraph with no sections, indents, or even line spacing.  

## HTML Links/images

Adding links and images are quite easy. It sometimes can be difficult to think of how your moving one image to another. In our mind, we just copy and paste right? Not so quite! But almost! In HTML we need to write where that link/image is coming from. One thing we must take note, '&copy' copywrite is a very big thing, especially around images, you can't copy every image you see on google and claim it to be your own, that's a big no no. Take note of how the image uses a self closing tag, while the link uses a opening and closing tag.  

We add our images in HTML by writing down `<img src="Image_Adress" alt="Description of the image">`, this allows us to take an image from either our local machine, our repo, or a different website and post it here for us. You always want to include a description of what the image is. That helps users with impaired vision understand the image, as sometimes it can read the description of the image out to them.  

For our links, it has the same concept, we write out `<a href="Where-do-we-want-to-be-directed">` This is what the user sees when clicking to that link`</a>`. Adding this, along side some CSS, we can change the image of the link, add more around it, or even make the user click on a image to redirect them to another page in there website, or another link.
