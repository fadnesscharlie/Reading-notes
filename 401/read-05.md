## Teaching a subject back

### Self Development

- Why:
  - The why is because as we develop especailly in the new tech world with teams now. We want to be able to adapt to the world around us and be open to the differnt things that we are going to be exposed to.
- What:
  - Different people, atmospheres, and even life styles. By accepting change, we open ourselves to different opportunities and new possibilities rather then closing ourselves and only seeing your view from your perspective only.
- How:
  - Changing how you interact, and how you address situations. Think about how you act around certain people. Whether it be family, friends, co-workers, or strangers. How we engage, listen, or push ourselves to be engaged in a conversation we dont want to be in. How do we act when we dont want to do something, do we expose ourselves and get to know them better, or do we think about something else while barely listening to them talk? Sometimes its all about how we address the situation and seeing ourselves from outside of our shoes.

## Linked List

- Linked List
  - A list of nodes with values and next
  - Data structure that links to the properties next and previous nodes
- Singly Linked list
  - Only one reference to a node
- Doubly linked list
  - A node with a next AND previous references
- Node
  - Item/obj/link
- Value
  - Value in the node
- Next
  - Property that connects to the next node
  - Connection to the next node: function, obj, boolean, etc
- Head
  - Reference to the first node in a linked list
- Current
  - Current reference in the linked list

## Big O

- A way to describe the complexity of your algorithm without running it
- Worst case Measurement of complexity

- Examples:
  - O(1)
    - Constant
      - Mega Super Efficient 1:1
  - O(n)
    - Linear Time
      - n = input
  - O(logN)
    - Super Omega Efficient
    - log: logrithmic
    - Simular to binary search
  - O(n^2)
    - Less Efficicent
    - Don't get this
