## Trees

### Binary Trees

Binary trees are data stored in forms of a lift and right node under them as a child. If they have a child under them, that makes them child/parent node. When going through a binary search tree, there 3 ways of going through the data. Using a recursive funciton that does three things. Push a value, check to see if they have left child, and check for a right child. They are a unsorted Data Structure.

There is:

- Pre Order
  - Insert Value, check left - run recursive fucntion, check right - run recursive function 
- In Order
  - Check left - run recursive fucntion, insert Value, check right - run recursive function 
- Post Order
  - Check left - run recursive fucntion, check right - run recursive function, insert Value, 

### Binary Search Trees

Binary Search Trees, are simular in the structure, but how the data is displayed and how you go across the data is much different. The data is placed in a way that makes it easy to find data because it is a sorted Data Structure. Being sorted, we can find our data very fast, as the left node will be less then or equal to the value you seek, and same with the right side. This makes it very fast, as sometimes you can even skip a lot of the tree to find the data you need making skipping half of the data structure possible.
