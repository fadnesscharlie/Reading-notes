## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Why is the Context API useful?
   1. By accessing data anywhere in the children and not having to pass it through each component saves a lot of time and code
2. Can a component outside of a provider get its context?
   1. No
3. What are some common use cases for using the Context API?
   1. You have a child component multiple levels down that needs this data but you do not want to have to pass it down to all its child components.
4. Describe “Context Hell”
   1. When creating and passing down multiple context api's through one compopent down to all its children.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms
- Global state
  - State that can be brought into components that do not have to be passed down as props
- Global context
  - Data that is shared throughout an application
- Provider
  - Creating the provider to pass in your data as value down to children components
- Consumer
  - A component that is a child of a context provider that is consuming the data
