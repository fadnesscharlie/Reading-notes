# Context API - Behaviors

- [Home](https://fadnesscharlie.github.io/reading-notes/401/)

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. When you have multiple contexts, what component type should you use (class/function) and why?
   1. Situational based and preference. Functional components are easier to read.
2. What are some good use cases for using the Context API for global state?
   1. When multiple components need access to this data
   2. Passing down state through components to reach a lower component is a good case for global state
3. How can you best test context?
   1. Passing it through its children, then testing the children and non children components.
