# Charlie Fadness's First Github Pages

> Hello! Thank you for coming and learning along side my journey into Software Development! In these reading notes, I will be adding information about topics that I have learned and went over. They will be explained in a way that even a person who has never wrote code will understand. I hope you learn a lot by reading, and I hope it guides you with more information about Software Development and what it does, and what you can do with it all. In my Reading Notes 401, we will dive deeper into API's, tests, node.js, POSTGRES(PostGreSQL), servers, React, and much more! Please refer to my previous classes is anything seems to be confusing for a refresher.
