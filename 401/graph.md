# Implementation: Graphs

## What is a Graph

A graph in a way to connect many to one and one to many. One example of how this is implemented is GPS, and Facebook's friend suggestion. By having multiple nodes and seeing if one relates to another, then another, we can find a path or correlation between the two. 

Take a map. When we want to see if we can get to one place or another, we think of intersections and freeway exits as nodes. When we can connect the dots from one place to another, we can find a way to get from one to the other using the shortest connected nodes.
