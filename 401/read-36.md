## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. What are the advantages of storing tokens in “Cookies” vs “Local Storage”
   1. Local Storage is more for client side, while cookies are more for server side
2. Explain 3rd party cookies.
   1. A way to track users and log where they have been to bring more ads and specific content based on the users searches
3. How do pixel tags work?
   1. By sending cookies to the server of the site when a user buys, clicks, fills out, or even access a site. This is an upgraded way to track users from cookies because it talks directly with the server.
