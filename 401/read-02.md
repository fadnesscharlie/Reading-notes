## ---Subject

- What’s the difference between PUT and PATCH?
  - Put will overwrite the whole data, while patch will only update the ones you specify.
- Provide links to 3 services or tools that allow you to “mock” an API for development like json-server
  - [MockAPI](https://mockapi.io/docs)
  - [Swagger](https://swagger.io/solutions/mocking-and-virtualization/)
  - [Postman](https://learning.postman.com/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/mocking-data/setting-up-mock/)
- Compare and contrast Swagger and APIDoc.js 1 Which HTTP status codes should be sent with each type of (un)successful API call?
  - 100s - Informational
  - 200s - Success
  - 300s - Redirects
  - 400s - Client Errors
  - 500s - Server Errors
- Compare and contrast SOAP and ReST
  - From my perspective SOAP is good with requests that done envolve a URL and if using XML.
  - REST is easier to learn, has an easier learning curve, worked very well with URL formatted API, and other data formats other then XML like JSON.

- Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?
  - Node
  - NPM
  - GitHub
- Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?
  - TDD
  - More about express
  - CI and CD
- What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?
  - Understanding more about backend and how it all works together, especially working with more API's and even creating our own API
