# AWS: API, Dynamo and Lambda

- [Home](https://fadnesscharlie.github.io/reading-notes/401/)

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. What are serverless functions?
   1. Serverless functions are functions that run on servers, but they are servers that you do not have to maintain in order to have them run.
2. If you were to create a system that emulated Lambda functions, how would you do it?
   1. If I were emulating the lambda functions, I would focus heavily on events. Having events throughout my application to trigger when needed, and then start/run/stop certain applications as I go.
3. Describe how a CDN works
   1. By storing cache of data in multiple places, when you access content, it is bringing that data from a local data center instead of sending a request to the main hosted area to bring faster information.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

- Serverless Functions
  - Functions that are created and ran by a server, but are hosted on a platform that does not require a server but has a simular approach to a server that doesnt require you to maintain it.
- Cloud Storage
  - A database that stores data over the cloud, meaning there is no giant harddrive holding this data, its over the web instead
- CDN
  - Content Delivery Network
