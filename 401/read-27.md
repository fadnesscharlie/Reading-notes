## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. How does React differ from vanilla JS/HTML/CSS?
   1. React implements and creates lots of helpful features, methods, and code to help assist in creating a more responsive application. You could still do all of this in Vailla, but the time it would take would be extrodinary. 
2. What is the primary difference between a function component and a class component?
   1. What you can do with functions vs classes. Functions are very simple, lightweight in a way. Classes can handle much more, and scales better with multiple methods.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

- Functional Components
  - The are components in React that not based off of classes but functions
- Children / Child Components
  - Components whom are the child of a parent/child component
