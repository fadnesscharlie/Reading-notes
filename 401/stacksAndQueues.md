## Stacks

Stacks are simular to linked list in how they work, but one main difference is that they can not reference previous. The stack resembles stacking blocks, making the stack vertical. The things you can do with them are much differnent as well. They work on a:

- FILO
  - First in last out
- LIFO
  - Last in First out

This can help and determine how you want your stack to be read. Some built in methods that work with stacks are:

- Push
  - You push a stack to the top
- Pop
  - Pop off the top stack
- Peek
  - Take a look at the top
- IsEmpty
  - Return a boolean depending on if it is empty


## Queues

Queues are simular to Stacks, but they are horizontal. Stacks have a front and rear, instead of just a top. Meaning you have some more options in how you want to run the code. Another difference in Queues is how its run:

- FIFO
  - First in First out
- LILO
  - Last in Last out

This method is much different and how you want your code to run can be your deciding factor if you want a stack or a queue.
