# AWS: S3 and Lambda

- [Home](https://fadnesscharlie.github.io/reading-notes/401/)

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Describe “The Cloud”
   1. The cloud is a storage, to store data like a database. Being able to store data in the cloud means there is more access to it, and if a location loses power, your data is still accessable through the cloud.
2. What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?
   1. Like a package, it bundles up your code, libraries, and all its dependencies so your program runs swiftly and being reliable from one computing environment to another.
3. What is auto-scaling?
   1. Auto-scaling is a method that an application adapts to the amount of information and data as well as growth of an application. By being able to auto-scale with your data, you do not need to implement new methods when your application reaches a certain height.
4. What is bandwidth?
   1. A range of frequencies for transmitting a signal
5. How do cloud providers compute service costs?
   1. By recording your request/response, api calls and function calls are some of the ways they compute cost

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

- Server Instances
  - Simular to the servers we run, but in the cloud and over the web
- Containers
  - A container is your bundled up code, libraries, etc ready to be run and talk to other computers
- Cloud Services
  - A range of services accessed for the cloud that users and programmers can use
- Cloud Architecture
  - Components and relationships between databases, software capabilities, applications, etc
- AWS
  - Amazon Web Services
- EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku
  - These are very simular in nature, the main difference is adding other structures of your application. With AWS, you can easily reference antoehr layer of the applocation while Heroku you have to move to a differnt hosting platform to add more structure to your application.
