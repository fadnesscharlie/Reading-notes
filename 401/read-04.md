## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development
   - Find bugs as you create software vs after
   - You can test certain features and see exactly when they are breaking
   - Inspires confidence
2. In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?
   - In creating and deleting databases
3. What is one downside of Test Driven Development
   - When first starting out, it can a hinderence especially if you are still learning a new concept.
4. Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?
   - Mostly focusing on how the objects are instantiated.
5. Why REST?
   - Flexability

## Document the following Vocabulary terms

- Functional Programming
  - The act of writing pure functions. With writing pure functions, there is less chance of side effects and bugs.
- Object Oriented Prgramming (OOP)
  - Writing code with a basis on classes and objects.
- Class
  - Super
    - Access and call function on an object's parents
  - This
    - Acts simular to functions
- Test Driven Development (TDD)
  - Creating test cases before the software is fully developed vs the usual instance of creating tests after the software is fully developed.
- Jest
  - A testing framework to ensure your javascript code is doing what you expected with quick results
- Continuous Integration (CI)
  - Keeping code up to date with multiple changes from multiple contributors. Builds and tests run while code is being merged to provide feedback and make sure nothing is being conflicted.
- REST
  - REpresentational State Transfer, handles the client-server relationship
- Data Model
  - A visual documentation of what you trying to model/create

## Preview

1. Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?
   - Differnce in database: one to one, one to many, etc
   - Primary and compond keys
   - When you should use certain databases
2. Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?
   - Primary and Compond keys
3. What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?
   - How to connect relational databases
