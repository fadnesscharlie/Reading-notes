## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Explain what a “Singleton” is (in Computer Science terms)
   - A node with only a next and not a previous.
2. Explain how the Singleton pattern can be used with Node modules, specifically with classes
   - By using classes, we a can create methods which use `this` making it easier to go across methods.
3. If you were tasked with building a middleware system like Express uses, what approach might you take to construct/operate it?
   - I am not sure.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

- Router Middleware
  - By recieving request and response from the routes, we do whatever we want when those routes are hit.
- Dynamic Module Loading
  - The process in which the applicaion or computer program can access, load, retrieve, and unload data from memory
- Singleton Pattern
  - Node mode with only next
- CRUD -> REST Method Matches
  - Create - POST
  - Read - GET
  - Update - PUT
  - Delete - DELETE
- Mock Testing
  - Mock testing is creating a simular application/server and testing there so you do not damage the application during testing.

## Preview

1. Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?
   - How password hacks happen
   - How high level encryptions work
   - Passwords in general
2. Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?
   - How everything works
   - Implementation
   - How to prevent password hacks
3. What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?
   - More on how the strength of the password can deter hacks and how to implement that.
