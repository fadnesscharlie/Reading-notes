# Advanced State with Reducers

- [Home](https://fadnesscharlie.github.io/reading-notes/401/)

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. How can we ensure that an effect hook runs only once?
   - We place a paramter as the second argument in our useEffect which will run once or run when something is updated
2. Can useState() update more than one state variable at the same time?
   - Yes, when we use a spread operator `...prevState` we can update the rest of the state.
3. Is useState() synchronous?
   - No

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

- State Hook
  - A way to add state to a functional component
- Component Lifecycle
