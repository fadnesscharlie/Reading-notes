# Access Control (ACL)

- [Home](https://fadnesscharlie.github.io/reading-notes/401/)

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. When is Basic Authorization used vs. Bearer Authorization?
   - Basic should be used when you just want to know who it is. Bearer should be used when you want to give them access to something
2. What does the JSON Web Token package do?
   - Creates a token that you can add levels of security too
3. What considerations should we make when creating and storing a SECRET?
   - We should be storing secrets in a hidden file like ENV

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

- Encryption
  - A way to secure information. By sending tokens, secrets, passwords, etc, you can encrypt them so when sending it along, makes it very difficult to find out what the actual characters being transported are
- Token
  - A token is a piece of information that is used to reference or compare
- Bearer
  - A token that is a string used with OAuth 2.0. It can be used with JWT or simular
- Secret
  - A secret that is added on encryption to add another level of security
- JSON Web Token
  - A token based format

## Preview

2. Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?
   - RBAC
   - Extra methods of security
3. What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?
   - Roles
