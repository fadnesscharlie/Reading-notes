# Event Driven Applications

- [Home](https://fadnesscharlie.github.io/reading-notes/401/)

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Why is access control important?
   - because having someone who just signed up being able to alter your data can lead to many headaches
2. Describe an application that would need access control.
   - Social Media, Inventory Logs, Banks
3. What is a role used for?
   - Giving specific access or permissions to a user
4. Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?
   - Having groups make things easier and being able to alter a whole group

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

- Authorization
  - What a person can do with their permissions
- Role Based Access Control
  - What a person can access when their permissions and what they can not access
- Capabilities
  - Types of roles

2. Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?
   - Events
   - How events will work
   - When events are bad
3. What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?
   - Being able to automate more of our stuff
