## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. What is the benefit of transforming data into packets?
   a. Being able to transfer data into packets helps to transfer it. By putting into small packets vs larger packets can make it easier for other applications to recieve the data
2. UDP is often refereed to as a connectionless protocol. Why is this?
   a. Because it sends data to the where it needs to be sent, but does not have to require a connection, but also leading to corrupted files that the application recieving the data will have to modify and find a way to patch the data.
3. Can a socket server application have multiple socket connections?
   a. Yes
4. Can a socket connection application be connected to multiple socket servers?
   - Yes
5. Can an application be both a socket server and a socket connection?
   - No

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

- Observer Pattern
  - a software design pattern in which an object, named the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods. [ref](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern)
- Listener
  - An event that only listens to when it needs to be called
- Event Handler
  - Handler for events
- Event Driven Programming
  - Creating a program that works by emitting events that activate when a certain things happens
- Event Loop
  - Creating a certain loop of events that benefits the application
- Event Queue
  - Simular to a line of events that happen in a certain order
- Call Stack
  - A stack of nodes or items
- Emit/Raise/Trigger
  - Envolke an event, simular to calling a function
- Subscribe
  - Subscribe the requesting client socket to changes/deletions of one or more database records [ref](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/reference/web-sockets/resourceful-pub-sub/subscribe)
- database
  - Place to store data
