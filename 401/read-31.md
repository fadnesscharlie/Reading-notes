# Context API

- [Home](https://fadnesscharlie.github.io/reading-notes/401/)

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Describe use cases useState() vs useReducer()
    1. Some use cases would be if you need to just update the state, vs doing something to modify the state that manipulates the size, object, or math.
2. Why do custom hooks need the 'use' prefix?
    1. To signify that it is a hook and should be treated as one vs a normal function
3. What do custom hooks usually do?
    Anything a normal function does, but would require it to be top level
4. Describe how a hook that fetches API data might work
    1. This would hook into an API and be called at top level to get that API data

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

- Reducer
  - Reduces values that we pass and place them into our bucket for the user.
