- [Home](https://fadnesscharlie.github.io/reading-notes/401/)

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Describe the similarities between AWS API Gateway + Lambda functions and an ExpressJS Server
   1. They are about the same, as they both run the same things, the main difference I would say is how you create them all.
2. List the AWS Database offerings and talk about the pros and cons of each
   1. DynamoDB
      1. Based on Mongo, uses a JSON format
   2. S3
      1. A bucket type data structure
3. Whatâ€™s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?
   1. They are the same
4. How can the server be assured a message was properly received?
   1. Through a function creation that will send back a message from the receiver

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

- Serverless API
  - An API that runs without a server on the cloud instead of a local machine
- Triggers
  - Something that makes functions run called from an action
- Dynamo vs Mongo
  - Table vs JSON format
- Dynamoose vs Mongoose
  - Mongoose is for smaller application, while Dynamoose is scalable for any application
