   1. Computers in homes that were marketed towards men
2. Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?
   1. It gave them the advantage of understanding how a computer works
## Review the data: Employee breakdown of key technology companies

1. What three take-a-ways do you have looking at this data?
   1. Women are increasing their numbers in tech
   2. Non white ethnicities are increasing in tech as well
   3. There has been an increase of one female in the fortune 500 CEO's

## Ask the question: Why diversity matters to your tech company

1. When are diversity efforts most successful?
   1. When creativity and organizations come together
2. Why do diverse companies perform better?
   1. There is a lot more potential in experience that can be brought to the playing field
3. Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.
   1. By having diverse people inside of your company, if you find that using certain verbage or even actions may affend them, you can better use the knowlegde to prevent it in your workplace from happening as you see it up close in action vs just seeing someone react in a certain way and not knowing why.
