# Charlie Fadness's First Github Pages

> Hello! Thank you for coming and learning along side my journey into Software Development! In these reading notes, I will be adding information about topics that I have learned and went over. They will be explained in a way that even a person who has never wrote code will understand. I hope you learn a lot by reading, and I hope it guides you with more information about Software Development and what it does, and what you can do with it all. In my Reading Notes 301, I will explain the introduction to Software Development. Please refer to my previous classes for a prep and basics on the small stuff as some of it will not be recovered here.
