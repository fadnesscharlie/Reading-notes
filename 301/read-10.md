## Understanding the JavaScript Call Stack

1. What is a ‘call’?
   1. Envoking the function
2. How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?
   1. One at a time
3. What does LIFO mean?
   1. Last In First Out
4. Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.
   1. niceTry() {sayItAgain()}
   2. satItAgain() {niceTry()}
5. What causes a Stack Overflow?
   1. When to many stacks are being created and they will not "pop" off.

## JavaScript error messages

1. What is a ‘refrence error’?
   1. When a variable is not declared
2. What is a ‘syntax error’?
   1. When the syntax itself is wrong, like a missed ",".
3. What is a ‘range error’?
   1. When a length can not be defined.
4. What is a ‘type error’?
   1. When the type of element/component is wrong. Ex. Thinking an array is a object.
5. What is a breakpoint?
   1. It is a place in code that will stop so you can use your developer tools to further pick apart your issue.
6. What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code?
   1. This creates a breakpoint in where you can access that specific area in your developer tools.
