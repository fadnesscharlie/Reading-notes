## Functional Programming Concepts

1. What is functional programming?
   1. a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data
2. What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
   1. It is a derministic function, which will return the same result if given the same arguments
3. What are the benefits of a pure function?
   1. The benefits would be that the outcome will be consistant and we know that the data will not change if the parameters are the same.
4. What is immutability?
   1. Something that can not be changed.
5. What is Referential transparency?
   1. It is when the result is always the same. Mixing pure functions and immutable data will always yield the same result.

## Modules and Require

1. What is a module?
   1. Simular to componets, its a snippet of code that we would like it do one thing.
2. What does the word ‘require’ do?
   1. Brings in a part of the componet from another file.
3. How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?
   1. We need to module.exports and require
4. What do we have to do to make a module available?
   1. Make a variable for the file component you want to use.
