# ES6 Classes in JavaScript

Classes bind things together under one network. This makes it easier when you need to keep modifying, or adding constantly. Its simular to having everything in one place vs multiple boxes you have to open and then change to match everything.

## extends keyword

When making a class, you can `extend` that class to another saying `class Dog extends Animal`. Making sure if you want to use the contuctors from animal, you create it with the same as ones you used in animal.

## super keyword

Using `super()` to get those into this class as well.

## Prototype Functions

When using prototype functions, instead of calling the constructor function, and labeling prototype. You can just make a function in the class, that will automatically make it into a prototype function where you can use `this`.
